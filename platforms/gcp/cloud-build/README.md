# Next.js + Bugster (via GCP Cloud Build)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

It also includes a **Cloud Build integration with Bugster** so that every **Pull Request targeting `main`** will automatically notify Bugster and trigger end-to-end tests.

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started (Next.js)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Trigger Bugster with Cloud Build

This project is configured to call Bugster automatically on every Pull Request to main using Google Cloud Build.

1. Cloud Build Config:

Inside this repo, youâ€™ll find a file at:

/platforms/gcp/cloud-build/cloudbuild.yaml


This file defines a simple curl step that POSTs to Bugsterâ€™s Custom Integration Webhook:
```bash
steps:
  - name: 'curlimages/curl'
    entrypoint: 'curl'
    args:
      - '-X'
      - 'POST'
      - 'https://api.bugster.app/webhooks/integrations/custom'
      - '-H'
      - 'Content-Type: application/json'
      - '-H'
      - 'X-API-KEY: ${_BUGSTER_API_KEY}'
      - '--data'
      - |
        {
          "deployment_state": "success",
          "project_id": "${_PROJECT_ID}",
          "organization_id": "${_ORG_ID}",
          "branch": "${_BRANCH_NAME}",
          "environment_url": "${_DEPLOYMENT_URL}",
          "environment": "production"
        }
options:
  logging: CLOUD_LOGGING_ONLY
```

2. Substitution Variables

The following substitutions must be configured in your Cloud Build Trigger:

Variable	Example Value	Notes
_BUGSTER_API_KEY	bugster_xxx	Bugster API Key (from dashboard)
_PROJECT_ID	0910-1757542431	Bugster Project ID
_ORG_ID	org_30bL1wM4DbhHnU85252QKw5	Bugster Organization ID
_DEPLOYMENT_URL	https://preview.example.com	Public URL of your PR preview/deployment
_BRANCH_NAME	main	Target branch (fixed to main)

_BUGSTER_API_KEY, _PROJECT_ID and _ORG_ID can be found in your project Settings under integrations tab.
 
Then, these variables are set once in Cloud Build â†’ Trigger â†’ Substitution variables.

3. Create the Trigger in GCP

Go to Cloud Build â†’ Triggers â†’ Create Trigger.

Select your GitHub repository.

Event: Pull request â†’ Target branch = main.

Configuration file: /platforms/gcp/cloud-build/cloudbuild.yaml.

Add the substitution variables listed above.

Save.

4. Flow

Developer opens a PR to main.

Cloud Build runs the trigger.

The curl step sends a webhook to Bugster.

Bugster receives the deployment URL and executes tests automatically.
